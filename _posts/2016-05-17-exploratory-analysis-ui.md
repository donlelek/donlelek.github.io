Yesterday I found [Exploratory Desktop](https://exploratory.io), and it's awesome. It's only OSX compatible right now, but Windows and Linux will be available eventually. Exploratory Desktop it's a User Interface (UI) for *R* and the very popular, Hadley Wickham's package *dplyr*, which is not a surprise since the developer also runs the [learn dplyr blog](https://blog.exploratory.io/).

After finding a post in [google+](https://plus.google.com/+ArthurZubarev/posts/jbasrX4C1Sr) I visited Exploratory website and signed up for the beta. The installation process was painless and after using the software for a day without any issues I think the product looks production ready.

This app will be useful to you whether you are an experienced user or a newcomer to either *R* and/or *dplyr*. It's focus is to quickly load, explore, clean and export your data. 

You start by creating a project, for each project you can have multiple data sources. For each data frame you will be presented a command input cell, a list of data wrangling steps, and three tabs: Summary, a screen with descriptives such as a histogram, average, median and proportion of missing values for all your variables; Table, your current data in tabular form; and Chart, a basic chart generation tool.

You can see it working in the following video:
