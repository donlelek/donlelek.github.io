I've been playing with [Shinyapps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) for a while and I just made one to get predictions for treatment failure from the model in the [paper](http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v118/n3/p227-235/) I published recently. You can get the code in the [app's Github repository](https://github.com/donlelek/srs-pred-app), or run it locally with:

```{r}
shiny::runGitHub("donlelek/srs-pred-app")
```
