I've been playing with [Shinyapps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) for a while and I just made one to get predictions for treatment failure from the model in the [paper](http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v118/n3/p227-235/) I published recently. You can get the code in the [app's Github repository](https://github.com/donlelek/srs-pred-app), or run it locally with:

```{r}
shiny::runGitHub("donlelek/srs-pred-app")
```

You can also see it working below. Change the values and see what happens.

Hope you liked it, I'd be happy to receive comments to improve the app or regarding the paper itself.

Cheers!
