My name is Derek Price, I am a Veterinarian from Chile specialized in Aquaculture, I am currently doing a PhD in Epidemiology at [UPEI](www.upei.ca).

I write about things I've learned (usually the hard way) and things I think may help others (including my future self) in their everyday life doing research. This blog is also a writing exercise, Spanish is my mother tongue and English is my second language.  

Thanks for reading, I hope you find it useful!
